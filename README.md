# 🎬 MovieFinder

**Never forget a movie again. Describe a scene or plot, and our AI finds the exact title—no more vague recommendations, just the movie you're thinking of.**

MovieFinder is a lightweight web application built for a hackathon that solves a common problem: remembering parts of a movie but forgetting its title. Simply describe what you remember, and our AI will find the movie for you.

- **AI-Powered Results**: Powered by Groq's fast AI inference for accurate movie identification
- **Clean Interface**: Simple, intuitive design built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Instant Results**: Get answers quickly without unnecessary fluff or distractions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **AI API**: Groq for natural language processing
